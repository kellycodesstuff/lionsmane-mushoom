                <p><i lang="la" class="taxonomy">Hericium erinaceus</i> (also called <strong>lion's mane mushroom</strong>, mountain-priest mushroom or bearded tooth fungus) is an edible mushroom belonging to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saprophytic">tooth fungus group</a>. Native to North America, Europe and Asia, it can be identified by its long spines (greater than 1 <abbr aria-title="centimeters">cm</abbr> length), occurrence on hardwoods, and tendency to grow a single clump of dangling spines. The fruit bodies can be harvested for culinary use.</p>
                <p><i lang="la" class="taxonomy">Hericium erinaceus</i> can be mistaken for other species of <i lang="la" class="taxonomy">Hericium</i>, which grow across the same range. In the wild, these mushrooms are common during late summer and fall on hardwoods, particularly American beech and maple. Usually <i lang="la" class="taxonomy">H. erinaceus</i> is considered <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saprophytic">saprophytica</a>, as it mostly feeds on dead trees. However, it can also be found on living trees, so may be a tree parasite. This could indicate an endophytic habitat.</p>

            <!-- Morphology -->
            <section id="morphology">
                <h2>Morphology</h2>
                <p>The fruitbodies of <i lang="la" class="taxonomy">H. erinaceus</i> are large, irregular bulbous tubercules. They are 5–40 <abbr aria-title="centimeters">cm</abbr> (2–15.5 <abbr aria-title="inches">in</abbr>) in diameter, and are dominated by crowded, hanging, spore-producing spines, which are 1–5 <abbr aria-title="centimeters">cm</abbr> long or longer. Fruit bodies and spines colour are white to cream, but can turn yellow-brown when older.</p>
                <p>The hyphal system is monomitic, amyloid, and composed of thin- to thick-walled hyphae that are about 3–15 microns (<abbr aria-title="microns">um</abbr>) wide. The hyphae also contain clamped septa and gloeoplerous elements (filled with oily, resinous substances), which can come into the hymenium as gloeocystidia.</p>
                <p>The basidia are 25–40 <abbr aria-title="microns">um</abbr> long and 5–7 <abbr aria-title="microns">microns</abbr> wide, contain four spores each and possess a basal clamp. The white amyloid basidiospores measure around 5–7 <abbr aria-title="microns">um</abbr> in length and 4–5 <abbr aria-title="microns">um</abbr> in width. The spore shape is described as subglobose to short ellipsoid and the spore surface is smooth to finely roughened.</p>

                <p>The fruitbodies of <i lang="la" class="taxonomy">H. erinaceus</i> are mainly produced annually from August to November in Europe. It was observed that <i lang="la" class="taxonomy">H. erinaceus</i> could fruit intermittently for 20 years on the same dead tree. It is hypothesized that <i lang="la" class="taxonomy">H. erinaceus</i> can survive for <strong>40 years.</strong> The mating system of <i lang="la" class="taxonomy">H. erinaceus</i> species found in the USA was shown to be bifactorially heterothallic.</p>
                <p>The monokaryotic mycelium growth of <i lang="la" class="taxonomy">H.erinaceus</i> is slower than dikaryotic growth and only about a low percentage of monokaryotic cultures yield fruitbodies. Monokaryotic fruitbodies are also smaller than dikaryotic fruitbodies. The monokaryotic mycelium was found to produce fusoid to subglobose chlamydospores of 6–8 x 8–10 <abbr aria-title="microns">um</abbr> size. These spores can stay viable for more than seven years and be stored under anaerobic conditions. Chlamydospore germination requires 30 to 52 hours, with a germination success rate of 32 to 54%.</p>
                <p>Spore production is highest at midday, relative to temperature increase and relative humidity decrease. Daily trends towards lower relative humidity can favor sporulation, however levels of relative humidity that are too low do not favor high total spore production.</p>

                <h2>Distribution</h2>
                <p><i lang="la" class="taxonomy">Hericium</i> species can be found throughout the northern hemisphere. <i lang="la" class="taxonomy">Hericium erinaceus</i> has been used in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traditional_Chinese_medicine">traditional Chinese medicine</a> for centuries and its production is widespread within Asia, mostly using extensive production practices on wood logs or stumps.</p>
                <p>Despite its higher prevalence in Asia, <i lang="la" class="taxonomy">H. erinaceus</i> was first described in North America. Its production there occurs only on a small scale. Most of it is intensive indoor production with only a few small outdoor sites where log cultivation is practiced. Three <i lang="la" class="taxonomy">Hericium</i> species can be found in eastern North America, one being <i lang="la" class="taxonomy">H. erinaceus</i>, the other two <i lang="la" class="taxonomy">H. americanum</i> and <i lang="la" class="taxonomy">H. coralloides</i>.</p>
                <p>Although <i lang="la" class="taxonomy">H.erinaceus</i> is native to Europe, it has been <strong>red listed in 13 European countries due to poor germination and establishment.</strong> This specific genus fruits between August and December in the United Kingdom, and will continue to produce spores until as late as February in the following year. It is able to withstand cold temperatures and frost conditions.</p>

                <h2>Conservation</h2>
                <p><i lang="la" class="taxonomy">Hericium erinaceus</i> is <strong>scarce and threatened</strong> and is one of only four fungi to have the highest level of legal protection in the UK, making <strong>both picking and sale of the fungus illegal.</strong></p>

            <!-- Strains and yield -->
            <section id="strains-and-yield">
                <h2>Strains and Yield</h2>
                <p>In fungi cultivation, fungal strains are analogous to plant varieties in crop breeding. Fungal strains comprise clonal descendants of a single isolation from one fungal colony in a pure culture. <i lang="la" class="taxonomy">Hericium spp.</i> grow in the wild in North America, Europe and Asia and, although there is considerable scientific research about them, they are not commonly industrially produced. Accordingly, there are few commercially available strains in the USA or Europe and little or no breeding for higher yield or other favorable traits has occurred. Production trials in Egypt report yields of <i lang="la" class="taxonomy">H. erinaceus</i> averaging at 165g per 1 kg medium.</p>
