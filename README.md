**SUMMARY**

This project was completed as part of the Modern Web Design course with Gymnasium (Instructor: Aaron Gustafson)

**SKILLS**

The skills I learned and used in this course, and complete this project included the following:

*HTML*
- Setting up an HTML document
- Basic and semantic HTML
- Organization and structure of a basic website
- Using tags, classes and id to efficiently organize content
- Linking to internal and external pages

*CSS*
- Basic CSS styling
- Media queries and responsive web design
- Borders and box shadows

**REFLECTION**

I found that learning HTML and CSS came quite easily and was pretty straight forward. I can see how both HTML and CSS can be quite messy if things are not laid out and organized properly. I learned quickly the importance of using comments to help others (and yourself) to quickly navigate the document. 

I struggled a little bit with creating media queries and with the design aspect of web development so there are key areas that I will need to focus more on in the future.

Part of the project for this course involved using JavaScript to create a reponsive hamburger menu that appeared when the page was being viewed on a mobile device. I was unsuccessful in figuring out how to incorporate this into my project and I felt that the lessons in the course weren't clear enough to help me to understand how to accomplish this feature with JavaScript. I will be using additional learning material to help learn JavaScript as well as to improve my understanding and application of both HTML and CSS.
